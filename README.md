# eMasjid

eMasjid is a communication application that bridges the gap between the masjid and its followers, many masjid attendees are unreachable and so having the option for a masjid to tweet announcements to its followers ( funerals, weddings, ramadan/eid dates, events, parent and toddler days, charity events, terrorism alerts ) etc is invaluable to the local community.
